This is my Homework Problem set 3 for ENVS193DS. For my data collection, I recorded the date, time, location, and price every single time I ate at a restaurant. I also included times that I bought snacks, such as energy drinks or chips. I also labeled each as a full meal, half meal, or snack. I also noted if I had gone grocery shopping recently.
