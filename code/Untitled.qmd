#Problem 1 a. With my data I have been tallying how much money I spend on eating out, and seperating that into what week of the quarter it is, and I would like to show the difference in money I spend eating out for each week. To do this, I would like to do statistical tests on the mean money spent per week, and try to find a trend on my spending habits as the quarter goes on.
