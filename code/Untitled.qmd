# Problem 1

a.  With my data I have been tallying how much money I spend on eating out, and seperating that into what week of the quarter it is, and I would like to show the difference in money I spend eating out for each week. To do this, I would like to do statistical tests on the mean money spent per meal, per week, and try to find a trend on my spending habits as the quarter goes on.

b.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

data <- read_csv(here("data", "Book2.csv")) #create an object of my data

weekly_avg <- data %>%
  group_by(week_of_quarter) %>%        # Group by week_of_quarter and compute mean price
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(week_of_quarter)


ggplot(weekly_avg, aes(x = factor(week_of_quarter), y = mean_price)) +  # Plot: Mean price per week of the quarter
  geom_col(fill = "dodgerblue") + #make the color blue
  labs(
    title = "Mean Spending on Eating Out per Week",
    x = "Week of Quarter",                          # title the axes and visual
    y = "Mean Price ($)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

c.  The mean amount of spending per meal, per week appears to be on the rise as the weeks get closer to the end of the quarter.

d.  

```{r}
weekly_avg %>% 
  mutate(mean_price = round(mean_price, 1)) %>% # Start with the weekly_avg data frame
  gt() %>% # Generate a formatted table using the gt package
  tab_header(
    title = "Average Spending Per Week of the Quarter" #give table a title
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    week_of_quarter = "Week of Quarter",   #title the two columns of my table
    mean_price = "Mean Price ($)"
  )
```

# Problem 2

a.  Since my data has to do with the money I am spending on food, maybe my visual could have something to do with food. Accoring to my data I eat a lot of Woodstocks and Rusties Pizza, so maybe I could a pie chart, where the circle is a pizza and the percent of the total money. I would have to turn my means into percentages of a total, but other than that I would look great.

b.  

c.  

d.  My work depicts the differences in average cost of meal that I spend each week, as slices of a pizza, which was inspired by my own spendings, when I noticed that I was spending lots of money on pizza. I created my visualization on Google Draw, and my process consisted of finding a good image, created sperations or slices, and putting some quantitative data to display how much of the pie said slice is.

# Problem 3

a.  This paper has a T-test that was comparing the average concentration of post storm ambient concentrations with ASBS discharge sites. the discharge sites were the predictor variable and the concentrations were the response variable.

b.  I think that they did a fairly good job showing the data, it lacks in artistic appeal, but the axes make sense and the figure does a great job showing summary statistics, such as center, spread, and how each contaminant compares to the each other.

c.  How well did the authors handle “visual clutter”? How would you describe the the data:ink ratio? The visual clutter is done fairly well, while they balance of information on this figure well, from an artistic standpoint theres a lot of empty space. The x axis is also very cramped, and I think they could have worked harder on making the axis titles not so in your face.

d.  I would change a few different things. First, we need to find a way to make the data with less variation more visually appealing. This might take changing the intervals on the y axis. Also, the x axis label is cramped. They a good job making it slanted for visual appeal, but maybe thinner font, so our eyes go to the data first. Also theres no units for the y axis so im not sue what the concentration is measuerd in. Also, id like to see the legend outside of the chart. Putting it to the side would help the visual flow.
